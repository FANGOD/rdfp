# rdfp
Zeek Remote desktop fingerprinting script based on FATT (Fingerprint All The Things).
https://github.com/0x4D31/fatt

## Background
This is the result of a collaboration with Adel K. while he was working on FATT's remote desktop fingerpinting.  This is a Zeek package to be used to fingerprint the Remote Desktop clients.

Please reference Microsoft's RDP specification located below.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rdpbcgr/5073f4ed-1e93-45e1-b039-6e30c385867c


## Install
zkg install https://github.com/yahoo/rdfp
Add "**@load ./rdfp**" to local.bro.

## How It Works

The script will create a new log which will log the details which build the fingerprint and some additional information.  The fingerprint is created by concatenating extracted fields from different data packets.  

First the Client Core Data packet is parsed and extracts the Major and Minor version of the client.  Next the Client Security Data is parsed and the Encryption Method and a list of the flags are added.  This is followed by the Client Cluster Data flags.  This is followed by the extEncryptionMethods value which is defined specifically for French locale clients.  The last group of data is the Channel Definition options for each channel defined which provide details about the data transport.

Here is an example output based on the [rdp_proprietary-encryption.pcap](https://github.com/zeek/zeek/tree/master/testing/btest/Traces/rdp) provided by Zeek.org.

```4,8,0000001b,0000000d,00000000,rdpdr:80800000-rdpsnd:c0000000-drdynvc:c0800000-cliprdr:c0a00000```

Associated MD5 hash
